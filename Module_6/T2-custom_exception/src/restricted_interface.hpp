/**
 * @brief a wrapper for class RestrictedPtr
 * 
 * TODO: Implement the following methods:
 *
 * MakeRestricted: a template function that takes any type of
 * pointer as a parameter and returns a RestrictedPtr holding
 * that pointer with the use set to "RestrictedPtr instance".
 * 
 * CopyRestricted: a template function that takes a reference to
 * a RestrictedPtr as a parameter and returns a copy of it. If
 * the copying fails, prints the error in the exception to
 * standard output with a newline appended and returns a
 * default constructed RestrictedPtr.
 *
 * operator<<: a template function that takes in a ostream 
 * reference and a RestrictedPtr reference, prints the object
 * pointed to by the pointer to the stream using the << operator 
 * and returns a reference to the stream. If the pointer is null,
 * prints the return value of GetError of the exception thrown by 
 * GetData instead.
